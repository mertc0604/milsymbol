# Military Symbol Studio

The repository includes an English military symbol editor in `studio/`, with a light interface, a search panel, tabbed configuration, and a persistent preview with an always-visible SIDC console.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run studio:build
npm run studio:serve
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:4173`.

The build creates `dist/studio/`, including a normalized searchable catalog generated from the standard data packages already used by milsymbol. The site offers MIL-STD-2525C/D/E and APP-6A/B/D/E views. APP-6E uses a compatibility catalog; its codes carry version 16 (APP-06(E)(2), Table A-1). FM 1-02.2 is not offered in the editor; the underlying library is unchanged. Symbols can be exported as SVG or PNG.

## Layout

- **Top bar:** standard selector, Help and the search launcher. Click it or press `/` to open the symbol search panel. The panel holds the symbol set list with counts, Recently used (the last 8 symbols per standard, stored in `localStorage`), and result tiles with mini previews. Browsing a set, the tiles sit under a closable heading for each group of the set and a subheading for each group inside it (APP-6A Ground units: COMBAT, then AIR DEFENSE, ARMOR, ...), taken from the catalogue hierarchy; All symbol sets has a heading per set. A search lists its matches as one grid. The preview heading names the symbol's set and groups in full; each opens the palette at that group. In the panel, `↑`/`↓` move between results, `Enter` selects, and `Esc` clears the search and then closes the panel. A full SIDC typed into the search finds its symbol.
- **Left column (sticky):**
  - Preview card: name, path, class badge (Unit, Equipment, Installation, Tactical point on APP-6A), render state and preview stage. Under it, Edit text (opens Amplifiers in Field positions) and two small download links, PNG and SVG. Exports always use the normal render.
  - The preview grid and the outline are switches in the Display tab; the grid is an editor aid only, exports have a transparent background.
  - SIDC console: wide enough for a 30-digit code on one line (on narrow screens Apply sits under it), Copy next to the length. Apply, `Enter` to apply, `Esc` to return to the current code. Messages appear inline only when there is something to say: applied, wildcard and standard-switch notes, and errors that name the SIDC position. The code breakdown is always visible and shows each part's meaning.
- **Right column:** three tabs.
  - **Symbol:** identity and status chips drawn by the renderer for the current symbol, context, unit designation (with the S staff length under Headquarters while it is on; on APP-6A equipment the flag is Location offset), echelon or mobility, country or organization flag, and edition-specific icon modifiers and frame shape. Every disabled control states its reason.
    - Identities: APP-6A offers its nine Annex B identities (including joker and faker). APP-6B and 2525C offer the seven standard identities with a Reality / Exercise context; exercise writes G, W, M, D, L, J or K into position 2. D/E editions offer the seven identities 0–6 with Reality / Exercise / Simulation in position 3, and exercise suspect and hostile are shown as Joker and Faker.
  - **Amplifiers:** two views of the same values. Field positions puts a box for each applicable field around the symbol in the order the standard places it; the boxes are spaced apart for typing, so the preview, not the boxes, shows the exact placement. A country flag keeps its place there too. The List shows only the fields that apply to the symbol in the selected edition, under the edition's own names, in fixed groups; a search (name or code) and "Filled only" hide fields without touching their values and say how many filled fields they hide. A help line at the bottom of the list, always the same height, shows the focused field's rule, format and example (edition-specific: APP-6A W DDHHMMSSZMONYY and Y latitude/longitude, 2525C W DDHHMMSSZMONYYYY and an AO without a code list, APP-6D installation AI component types). "Not available for this symbol", closed under the list, names the edition's fields that do not apply to the symbol class or identity and the graphics the standard defines that this editor cannot set (2525C AH/AI/AK and the S offset, APP-6A installation S offset, APP-6D Land Unit AC and installation Q offset line). Fields of other editions are not listed. Q (direction of movement: slider and degrees) and AJ (speed leader) are graphic amplifiers in the list, after Z (speed), shown only where the edition gives them to the symbol class (not on 2525C or APP-6D installations, where APP-6D Q is the offset location line; APP-6A has no AJ); a value set earlier is kept, unsent, and the closed list says so. Field positions lists them under "Not drawn here". W has "Now (UTC)" in the field's format; J has a reliability/credibility picker that opens on request; APP-6D AO is built from lists, with the bar colour (target, non-target, expired) under it for hostile tracks.
  - **Display:** display switches (fill, frame, icon, text labels, country flag, outline, preview grid), size, stroke, palette and stack (not in APP-6A), and, closed under "More style options", custom fill color, monochrome, modifier color (HQ staff, task force, feint/dummy, installation and echelon), fill opacity, text color, size and background, and outline width and color. None of the style options change the SIDC.

Below 1100 px the two columns stack, and the compact symbol in the tab bar links to the preview. Below 760 px the preview shrinks and stays on top while the settings scroll under it (on screens at least 600 px tall), the SIDC console follows the settings, and the code breakdown folds into Code details.

The symbol draws before the flag artwork arrives: `flags.json` is the largest download, so it loads after the first render, and the flag list says Loading flags… until then. The Studio runs the minified bundle.

Exports are named `standard_sidc_symbol-name`, for example `app6e_160310000012110000000000000000_infantry.png`. PNG exports are three times the symbol size; the tooltip of the PNG button gives the size in pixels.

A country flag sits as in the Unit Generator: 20 units right of the frame and 10 up from its bottom, whatever the text. The two text rows beside it start 70 units further right, through the library's `country_flag` option.

APP-6E shows a Compatibility view badge beside the render state, because its symbols come from the shared 2525E catalog.

The Amplifiers tab provides 27 text controls (plus Q and AJ) grouped by purpose: identity and
organization, information and assessment, time/location/movement, equipment and
installations, and engagement/maritime. New fields include quantity,
reinforced/reduced, staff comments, evaluation rating, combat effectiveness,
IFF/SIF/AIS, altitude/depth, speed, special headquarters, country text,
platform type, teardown time, common identifier, installation composition,
engagement bar and type, guarded unit, and special designator. Each field has
its identifier and guidance; actual placement follows the renderer's symbol-set
rules. APP-6A retains publication-specific applicability and length limits.
Reset clears every amplifier, including fields hidden by the current edition.
Text values are included in SVG/PNG, separately from the SIDC.

Graphic controls include speed-leader length, HQ staff length, and an optional
symbol stack outside APP-6A. E editions also offer frame-shape overrides,
encoded at SIDC position 23. Map range rings and
general-rank stars from the reference generator are separate features, not
rendered modifiers supplied by this library.

Echelon and mobility start unspecified, including after Reset or switching their
mode. A deliberately selected value is not silently replaced by clicking the
same mode. Search accepts names, function codes and full SIDCs; Clear / Escape
resets search and pagination. Section switches return the form to its top.
On narrow screens, the compact symbol links to the full preview/download panel.
The editor opens on APP-6A. Standard tabs are grouped in edition order:
APP-6A/B/D/E, then MIL-2525C/D/E. The desktop preview receives approximately
one third of the workspace, with a larger symbol stage.

The SIDC input accepts `*` placeholders in letter-based publication examples,
including whitespace and line breaks copied from PDFs. Identity and status
placeholders use the current editor selections; other `*` characters become
`-` (unspecified). Explicit identity, status and modifier codes are preserved.
The input and exported SIDC show the resolved code. Numeric SIDCs still require
20–30 digits.

Applying a SIDC selects the matching catalog entry and synchronizes identity,
status, echelon/mobility, HQ/task force/feint, and numeric modifiers. Subsequent
control edits replace only their own SIDC fields, preserving country, order of
battle and national extensions. Unknown catalog entries retain their entered
function code. Recognized numeric D/E versions select the corresponding edition
within the current NATO or MIL family before decoding extension fields.

APP-6A (1998) displays 713 publication-derived S-scheme tactical symbols.
Seven of those entries are taxonomy headings without separate Annex D artwork.
They remain selectable, with a **Category** badge and an explanatory preview note.
G-scheme tactical graphics are excluded from this editor view and from manual
APP-6A code entry. The library retains its existing 907-entry point profile.
The editor provides
edition-specific SIDC validation, Present/Planned status, and automatic installation
modifiers. It reuses the library's NATO drawing primitives; it is not a complete
implementation of multipoint tactical graphics or weather symbols. See
[APP-6A support and publication errata](docs/app6a.md).

The current visual audit covers only the 713 S-scheme entries. Follow the local
commands in [APP-6A documentation](docs/app6a.md), then open
`/audit/symbols/index.html` for publication / before / current / difference views.
G graphics are excluded.

## Edition profile controls

Every edition has a profile, so the Studio keeps no copy of an edition's rules. The profiles in `src/modifierprofiles/` are copied to `vendor/modifierprofiles/` and queried at runtime (`studio/profile-controls.js`):

- **Offered values.** Each candidate identity, status, HQ/task force/feint flag, echelon, mobility, towed array or sector code is written into the SIDC and passed to `profile.validate(sidc, {})`. A value is offered only if it adds no `*Errors` entry. Errors that every candidate shares (a bad sector elsewhere in the code) are ignored, so one problem does not hide every choice.
  - 2525C: identities D, L, M, J and K disappear for dimension Z; statuses C, D, X and F disappear for units; mobility and towed array appear for equipment only, echelon for units only. Task force is offered on every class, with a note off units.
  - APP-6D: context 1 and 2 are labelled "US only"; identity and status names come from `app6dIdentityName` and `app6dStatuses` (status 2-5 is not offered for Land Unit); amplifier values follow the symbol class, and HQ, task force and dummy are offered on every class because Annex A defines them for every dimension; the sector 1 and sector 2 selectors list only the codes of the Annex A dictionary for the symbol set, show where the sector sits (`sectorPlacement`, left and right for Air Missile) and disable codes the current entity may not use. The engagement bar AO is three dropdowns (A, BBB, CC) that compose `A:BBB-CC`; the counts for MLT come from the profile's own grammar.
  - APP-6A: identity `O` is never offered; an imported `O` stays as a flagged chip. The `uncertaintyMarker` option (publication default, field E, inside the frame) appears for pending, assumed friend and suspect.
  - APP-6(B), MIL-STD-2525D, MIL-STD-2525E and APP-6(E): fields, flags, statuses and amplifiers follow each symbol class, from Table I, Table VII, Table VI and Table 1-5 with the placement figures. HQ, task force and dummy are offered on every class, with a note where the class table gives them no field. APP-6(B) offers status A and P only. 2525D land units have no operational condition; 2525E and APP-6(E) land units do. 2525E and APP-6(E) add the restricted target and no-strike contexts (3-8); APP-6(E) draws their marks. The positions, the decisions where a table and a figure disagree, and the limits are in [Amplifier profiles](docs/edition-modifiers.md).
- **Rejected selections.** When a symbol or edition change leaves a value the profile rejects, the Studio falls back (Present, Friend, unspecified echelon) and says so beside the control. An applied SIDC is never rewritten: its rejected values stay, flagged "not valid here".
- **Field metadata.** `minLength`, `pattern`, `alternates`, `examples`, `unresolved` and `supported:false` from the field definitions drive hints, format warnings, datalist suggestions and a "Defined for this symbol, not editable here" list.
- **Text that changes meaning.** The Studio remembers under which field definition each text was typed. When the edition or symbol makes the field absent, or gives the same code a different meaning (APP-6D K on units, equipment and installations; P as IFF/SIF or AIS; AC as country text or installation graphic), the text is kept and a non-blocking "Check these entries" list explains it, with a Clear button. A select value the new edition does not define is cleared with a note and returns when a list defines it again.
- **Profile notes.** `details.notes`, `details.unresolved` and `details.versionExtension` appear under the SIDC console.

## Distribution and attribution

This is an independent modified version of
[milsymbol by Måns Beckman / Spatial Illusions](https://github.com/spatialillusions/milsymbol).
The original `LICENSE` and bundle license banner remain intact. The editor's
catalog uses `mil-std-2525`, `milstandard-e` and `stanag-app6`, each distributed
under MIT with its original copyright notice. The build includes their full
license texts in `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt`, linked from the editor, and copies
the original library license to `LICENSE.txt`.

For a public site, run `npm run studio:build:public` and publish **only**
`dist/studio-public/`, not the local `dist/studio/` audit directory. This separate
allow-listed build omits PDF reference images, audit snapshots and local hosting
configuration. Its publication-audit link is hidden. Nothing is deployed by
this command.

### GitHub Pages

The `.github/workflows/pages.yml` workflow runs the rendering tests, builds the
public site, and deploys only `dist/studio-public/`. It runs on pushes to `main`
or `master`, and can also be started manually from the Actions tab. In the fork's
**Settings → Pages**, select **GitHub Actions** as the publishing source. Forks
may also require enabling Actions before their first run.

The site uses relative asset URLs, so it works at a repository subpath such as
`https://<owner>.github.io/<repository>/` without changing the renderer or
adding a framework. PDF references and generated visual-audit files stay local;
they are not required by the build or deployed by the workflow.

Using GitHub's Fork button is recommended for the visible upstream relationship
and future contributions; MIT does not require it. Preserve original copyright
and permission notices whether publishing a fork, another repository or a static
site. Do not publish an unchanged upstream package name as though this were an
official release. The editor explicitly identifies itself as an independent
extension and does not claim full APP-6A conformance.

The NATO publication is a separate reference document, not relicensed by the
software's MIT license. PDF/crop redistribution rights have not been established;
keep them local unless separately authorized. These packaging measures are not
a legal certification of every possible use of the standard.

Country / organization flags are available under Appearance for every edition.
The Studio uses a separate SVG extension and MIT-licensed flag-icons artwork,
plus a public-domain NATO flag (provenance in `studio/flags/NOTICE.txt`),
not the proprietary country-flag extension from Spatial Illusions. The selected
flag sits at the lower right, beyond the complete symbol width, preserving labels and arrows.
SVG download, SVG copy, compact preview, and PNG export share the same embedded
vector artwork. The artwork represents the same national flags, but is not a
pixel-identical copy of the reference site's proprietary assets. Flags are
bundled locally and require no external service.

Country selection and SIDC entry are linked in both directions:

- APP-6A / APP-6B: FIPS country code at positions 13–14 (`TU` for Türkiye).
- MIL-STD-2525C: ISO alpha-2 at positions 13–14 (`TR` for Türkiye).
- APP-6D / MIL-STD-2525D: ISO numeric at positions 21–23 (`792` for Türkiye).
  This is the **symbology originator** of national extensions, not a separate
  nationality field. APP-6D Annex A, Figure A-1, A.12 and Table A-9 define it;
  MIL-STD-2525D A.5.5 uses the same arrangement. The Studio uses that originator
  country for the flag. Positions 24–30 remain the originator's symbol set/data.
- MIL-STD-2525E: nationality/country code at positions 28–30 (`792` for Türkiye).
  Positions 21–22 remain common modifier identifiers, and 23 remains frame shape.
- The Studio's APP-6E compatibility view shares the 2525E catalog and encoding;
  it does not claim a separately verified APP-6E catalog or SIDC layout.

The renderer applies the common modifier identifiers at 21–22 only in edition E;
an edition D national-originator code cannot change the core symbol's modifiers.

Applying a SIDC selects its country automatically. Empty, incomplete or unknown
country fields clear any previous flag; there is no fallback between FIPS and
ISO. Selecting another country preserves the rest of a custom SIDC, including
order of battle. Switching standard preserves the selected country and encodes
it for the new edition. Flags with no assigned code (for example organizations)
remain display-only and explicitly say so; their selection clears any previous
country code. The Country (AC) free-text amplifier remains independent. Reset
clears the flag. Historical dissolved countries are not silently mapped to
modern successors. Mapping provenance is recorded in `studio/country-code-data.js`.
